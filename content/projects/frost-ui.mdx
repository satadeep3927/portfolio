FrostUI CLI is a powerful command-line tool for installing and managing FrostUI React Native components, inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It handles everything from authentication and component discovery to asset wiring and theming, so you can focus on building your app instead of boilerplate.

Designed for React Native and Expo projects, FrostUI CLI gives you a smooth way to pull in reusable, well-structured UI primitives with minimal manual setup.
