Loom is a durable workflow orchestration engine built in Python, inspired by systems like Temporal and the Durable Task Framework. It focuses on making long-running business processes reliable, observable, and easy to reason about.

By combining deterministic workflows with event-sourced state, Loom enables workflows that can survive restarts, failures, and deployments without losing progress.

### Key Features

- **Durable Workflows**: Long-running workflows that can safely pause, resume, and recover
- **Event Sourcing**: Uses an event log to persist and replay workflow state
- **Deterministic Execution**: Clear separation between pure workflow logic and side-effecting activities
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic recovery from crashes via replay
- **Developer Friendly**: Python-first API for defining workflows and activities
- **Pluggable Persistence**: Backed by SQLite initially, extensible to other storage backends
