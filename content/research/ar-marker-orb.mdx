This paper presents a novel approach to augmented reality marker detection using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features. Our method significantly improves detection accuracy in challenging lighting conditions while maintaining real-time performance.

**Abstract:** Traditional AR marker detection methods often struggle with varying illumination and perspective distortions. We propose an enhanced detection pipeline that leverages ORB feature descriptors combined with geometric verification to achieve robust marker tracking. Experimental results demonstrate a 25% improvement in detection accuracy compared to existing methods, with maintained real-time performance at 30+ FPS on mobile devices.
